# Tiny Village: Horizontally Scaling Society

## Introduction

Sustainability means moving away from the infinite growth paradigm towards one where resources are recognized as being finite.  One of those key resources for human society is land.  In my opinion, land usage in modern suburbia is amazingly bad, and suburban land is one of the most underutilized resources remaining.

Suburban homes have tended recently towards growing larger and larger.  This means increasing use of resources for heating and cooling of rooms that usually are mostly empty space.  At the same time, anywhere land is not obviously at a premium, homes often have large back yards.  These back yards are blank spaces in our sustainability plan.  About 95% of the time they are used mainly as a place for the family dog to defecate.  5% of the time a child plays there, and another 5% of the time someone putters in a tiny garden that produces next to nothing.  Often back yards are mainly for vanity.

## Commuting

Another tragedy of the modern city is the concept of commuting many miles to work in vehicles that weigh thousands of pounds and are designed to carry many passengers rather than an individual.

More often than not the destination is an office building or a strip mall.  In the case of the office worker, telepresence and telecommuting is an obvious and massively underutilized development.  The internet is everywhere and is increasingly being used to stream cat videos, gaming, TV shows and other video.  Why not use it for video and audio conferencing whenever we need to discuss work topics face-to-face, rather than driving many miles each day?  We are wasting gas, wasting our time, wasting space for office buildings that are unoccupied 60-70% of the time.

## The Tiny House Movement

Most people have heard of the "tiny house" by now.  This brilliant idea is one of the shining examples of making sustainable living real.  The question for many people, however, is, "where do I park my tiny house?".

The suggestion is often given to be an RV park, or a tiny "homestead" in a remote or unpopulated area.  All of the typical answers to the question of where to park a tiny house generally miss the main points.  First of all, the primary reason tiny houses have wheels is to get around outdated local laws.  So they aren't really recreational vehicles or vehicles at all.  As far as moving to an unpopulated area to get around outdated local laws that insist on large homes etc., this is avoiding the problems rather than solving them.

There are some tiny house community developments that are popping up.  The main thing missing from these ideas is the concept of mixed land use which is key to scaling society in a predictable and tractable way.


## Horizontal Scaling

Some people may be familiar with "cloud" computing.  Cloud computing is all about horizontally scaling computer architecture.  In other words, instead of building one or two giant super-powerful database servers and one giant application server, one might create many small inexpensive servers that each contain a small database and application within them.

The advantage of this is that it takes less initial investment and is easier to incrementally scale up as you go.

I propose that we move our human development and zoning towards a similar horizontal scaling architecture.  Instead of putting all of our giant suburban houses in giant suburbs separated by miles from massive agricultural spaces and separate from massive office and industrial areas, lets create smaller self-contained units for everything.  So we can have tiny houses, and near them the supporting tiny agriculture and tiny offices and tiny retail places. 

## Goals

Goals are to improve food security, land use, as well as energy and resource efficiency, reduce commute times, reduce injury and deaths from vehicle accidents, and overall increase quality of life.

## Subdivision of Surburban Lots

The core idea is to subdivide each  residential surburban 
lot into 9 lots.  Given a typical lot size of 60'x60',
that means each plot is 18'x18' with two 6' passages.

## Subdivision Zoning

Mixed-use zoning helps implement the project goals.  Each 
subdivision is required to contain the following zones:

* 4 residential (optionally with commercial in the same space)(R [C])
* 3 high-tech agricultural (co-op or commercial)
* 2 commercial

This zoning ensures that each subdivision has a minimum of 
agricultural space, commercial space, and also encourages people
to run businesses out of their homes.  Structure height is limited
to a maximum of two stories.

## Passive Tiny Homes

Regulations for residential construction can specify 
passive/efficient requirements such as maximal insulation, airtight 
construction with HRV, cooling tubes or heat pump, solar,
energy storage, greywater recyling, etc. 

Separate structures will reduce noise pollution and increase
privacy when compared to attached units.

## Localizing Food Production

Regulations can specify efficient agricultural methods such as
advanced permaculture, aquaponics, aeroponics, hydroponics, 
and vertical farming.

## Village Sections

Ideally several suburban plots together are each subdivided.
For example, to start small, suppose six homes at one end of a
street convert.  What was originally just 6 large residences 
becomes 24 tiny homes(/businesses), 18 agricultural spaces,
and 12 commercial spaces, for a total of 54 spaces.  Land use
is improved by 800%.  

## Road Safety

This part of the street is barricaded to prevent normal vehicle traffic from entering.

To improve safety and reduce noise pollution in village areas:
 
* combustion engines are prohibited
* maximum vehicle weight including passengers and cargo is 300 pounds
* maximum speed is 25 mph 
* human powered transport like bicycles, recumbant trikes, and velomobiles are encouraged
