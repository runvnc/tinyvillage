# 3d Animation

## Phase 1 - Outline
Please read https://runvnc.github.io/tinyvillage.  The following may make small changes to that concept.

The Tiny Villages concept will be shown with a 3d model animated to show different views with annotations and
highlights breaking down different aspects of the system.

This will be a 3d line drawing, with no textures or lighting, showing simplified outlines of core shapes.

### View 1 -- Tiny Village versus Suburban Home

There are two 60x60' residential plots shown in this initial view.

The left side of the screen shows a 3d outline of the tiny village concept. There are 9 buildings and two 6' passages.
The buildings and passages are layed out in the following pattern:

R-- residential/commercial
C-- commercial
A-- agricultural

    | C|R|C
    |       
    | R|R|R
    | A|A|A 

In the initial view, the zoning (commercial/residential/agricultural) is not labeled or highlighted.

Each building is 17 x 17 feet and two stories, except for two of the residential which are a single story.  For phase 1 they
are simply modeled as boxes.  The agricultural buildings have large windows on three sides and 2/3 of the top.  
Each building has five 250 watt solar panels, modeled as rectangles/flattened cubes for phase 1, and a VAWT 
(vertical access wind turbine) modeled as cylinders for phase 1.

On top of the buildings, except for the three agricultural, is a small garden area outlined in green (garden details left out
of initial outline view).

The floor of the passages is covered with [solar roadways](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solar-roadways#/) represented
with hexagonal tiling for phase 1.
There are two [velomobiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIAu2b_rHw) parked on the side passage, 
modeled as small blimp-like shapes for phase 1. 

On the right hand side of the screen, shown as being 'next door', is a simplified (low poly, 3d lines) representation of a 
suburban home with a back yard.  The home occupies 2/3 of the lot, with 1/3 back yard.  Tiny brown cigars in the back
yard represent pet waste from the family dog.  There is a sedan parked in the driveway. 

A bottom section has annotations for the left and right side.  
The left side is captioned "Tiny Village" and the right "Suburban Home".  A series of
comparisons is displayed below the captions:

* left: Occupants: 9, right: Occupants: 3
* left: annual kwh used: 10000, right: annual kwh used: 12000
* left: annual calories produced: 300000, right: annual calories produced: 0
* left: annual kwh produced: 16000, annual kwh produced right: 0
* left: r-value, walls: 60, r-value, walls: right: 25
