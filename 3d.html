<h2 id="phase-1-outline">Phase 1 - Outline</h2>
<p>Please read the Tiny Village concept background, listed after this spec.  The following may make small changes to that concept.</p>
<p>The initial project will be awarded for Phase 1 only.  Determination whether to continue with the same contractor for Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 will be made later.  If you reply to this post, please specify how much experience you have with realistic architectural 
rendering, animation, etc.  If you are only interested in doing the &quot;3d-line&quot; style annotated animations and not the detailed models 
and renderings, or visa versa, that is possible since it is split into phases (please mention if that is the case).</p>
<p>If you reply, please include a minimal amount of information, such as initial questions, estimates/rates, availability, comments, etc.
I would like something more to go on than just a link to a portfolio without having to ask for that in a follow-up.</p>
<p>In general I would prefer over-communication rather than even slightly under.  Please feel free to make suggestions.</p>
<p>The Tiny Villages concept will be shown with a 3d model animated to show different views with annotations and
highlights breaking down different aspects of the system.</p>
<p>This will appear as if a 3d line drawing, with no textures or lighting, showing simplified outlines of core shapes. Almost like a
wireframe, but with hidden lines.  I believe this is accomplished in Blender using Freestyle line rendering.</p>
<h3 id="view-1-tiny-village-versus-suburban-home">View 1 -- Tiny Village versus Suburban Home</h3>
<p>There are two 60x60&#39; residential plots shown in this initial view.</p>
<p>The left side of the screen shows a 3d outline of the tiny village concept. There are 9 buildings and two 6&#39; passages.
The buildings and passages are layed out in the following pattern:</p>
<p>R-- residential/commercial
C-- commercial
A-- agricultural</p>
<pre><code>| R|R|R
|       
| C|R|C
| A|A|A 
</code></pre><p>In the initial view, the zoning (commercial/residential/agricultural) is not labeled or highlighted.</p>
<p>Each building is 17 x 17 feet and two stories, except for two of the residential which are a single story.  For phase 1 they
are simply modeled as boxes with rectangles for windows.  The agricultural buildings have large windows on three sides and 2/3 of the top.<br>The other buildings have one small window on the south side. Each building has four 250 watt solar panels, modeled as rectangles/flattened cubes for phase 1, and a VAWT 
(vertical access wind turbine) modeled as cylinders for phase 1.</p>
<p>On top of the buildings, except for the three agricultural, is a small garden area outlined in green (garden details left out
of initial outline view).</p>
<p>The floor of the passages is covered with <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solar-roadways#/">solar roadways</a> represented
with hexagonal tiling for phase 1.
There are two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIAu2b_rHw">velomobiles</a> parked on the side passage, 
modeled as small blimp-like shapes for phase 1. </p>
<p>On the right hand side of the screen, shown as being &#39;next door&#39;, is a simplified (low poly, 3d lines) representation of a 
suburban home with a back yard.  The home occupies 2/3 of the lot, with 1/3 back yard.  Tiny brown cigars in the back
yard represent pet waste from the family dog.  There is a sedan parked in the driveway. </p>
<p>A bottom section has annotations for the left and right side.<br>The left side is captioned &quot;Tiny Village&quot; and the right &quot;Suburban Home&quot;.  A series of
comparisons is displayed below the captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>left: Occupants: 6, right: Occupants: 3</li>
<li>left: annual kwh used: 12000, right: annual kwh used: 12000</li>
<li>left: annual calories produced: 300000, right: annual calories produced: 0</li>
<li>left: annual kwh produced: 13000, right: annual kwh produced : 0</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="view-2-zoom-in-on-suburban-home">View 2 -- Zoom in on Suburban Home</h3>
<p>Zoom in to the right side showing a larger version of the suburban home.  On the side of the screen add a 
few annotaions with lines pointing to the objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>pet waste</li>
<li>grass</li>
<li>3,000 pound vehicle</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="view-3-zoom-back-out-zoom-in-on-tiny-village">View 3 -- Zoom back out, zoom in on Tiny Village</h3>
<p>Zoom back out, then zoom in on the left side with the tiny village.  Then there is a series of annotations
shown one at a time highlighting different features of the village.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Highlight residential sections using red lines: the two single story structures, both floors of one of the remaining residential,
and the top floor of the other residential.  Label &#39;residential&#39;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highlight commercial sections using blue lines and label &#39;commercial&#39;. This includes the bottom floor of one of the 
residential(/commercil) buildings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highlight agricultural sections using green lines and label &#39;agricultural&#39;. Include 3 buildings and rooftops of other buildings. 
Show 300,000 calories produced annually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highlight and label solar roadways (hexagonal passage sections) and velomobiles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highlight and label solar panels and VAWT with kwh generated. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Reveal utility area under central passage/roadway, showing batteries and water storage tanks with storage capacity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-2-rendered-with-some-interior-details">Phase 2 - Rendered with Some Interior Details</h2>
<p>This will not be a realistic render, but rather illustration-type stylized with zero or minimal reflections or refractions.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-adding-basic-details">Part 1 -- Adding basic details</h3>
<p>Add some basic details to the models like windows and doors.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-adding-tiny-village-features">Part 2 -- Adding tiny village features</h3>
<h4 id="roof-gardens">Roof gardens</h4>
<p>The roof gardens are halfway occupied with potato bags, burlap bags with potatoes growing in them.  The other half is mostly either corn or wheat.
Half of the buildings corn, half wheat.</p>
<h4 id="agricultural-buildings">Agricultural buildings</h4>
<p>There are three agricultural buildings.  We need to somehow depict the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>For two of the buildings, the top floor is mostly full of potato sacks</li>
<li>About 1/3 of the space is rectangular containers containing sweet potatoes</li>
<li><p>There is a central space with spiral staircase that also lets in some light from the skylight above</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bottom floor of one of the buildings has a tilapia farm.  This can basically be shown as 3 large tanks of varying sizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bottom floor of one of the buildings contains 8 chickens.  There are 4 little mini-coops, about 2x2&#39;, for the chickens to nest in,
spread about the area and connected with runs, which are basically two 2x4s attached edge-to-edge.  At one size of the building is
a shared mini-coup sized to house 4 more friendly chickens.  Attached to two runs is a large container with the top exposed, containing
vermipost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All three buildings have two large vermipost containers on the bottom floor of the north (the side without the skylights) wall.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The third agricultural building is not full of potatoes or chicken or fish.  Instead, it is an aeroponics setup inspired by the greenhouse in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4gsnFJRAB0">this youtube video</a>.  For phase 1, don&#39;t try to get all of the details of that system,
just show the vertical columns with a minimal variety of plants, and copy that column at different angles to show the 
space being mostly used up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="building-features">Building Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Show that the buildings are made of SIPs (structural insulated panels) (which helps to simplify construction and make it easy to
be airtight).  Show a simplified representation of a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) in each building.  Can just be a box labeled
HRV. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Show rain catchment system which could either be a gutter with pipes leading from the roofs towards the utility area, or maybe just
a screened drain along the edge of the utility roadways connecting to the storage tanks labeled as rain catchment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Show a greywater recylcing system with pipes connecting from a bathroom sink and shower to the toilet tank.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Show a little bit of detail on the velomobiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="residential">Residential</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Do a model with interior and exterior showing mylar/foil-like radiant barrier as seen on Hexayurt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Glass walls for bathroom with blinds</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lexan (clear plastic) for cupboards in kitchen</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tatami mats in one sparse residential and small memory foam instead of regular bed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commercial-buildings">Commercial Buildings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Offices and tiny bathroom downstairs, conf. room with microwave nook upstairs</p>
</li>
<li><p>General store using two stories</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bottom floor tiny Hibachi grill in the middle, chef, commercial fridge, bar around him with seats,
top floor residential</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-3-figure-out-how-to-render-it-">Part 3 -- Figure out how to render it.</h3>
<p>We can probably do a cut-away. The problem is that there two floors, and are so many buildings close together, and so many features
that are supposed to be labeled, I&#39;m not sure what the exact viewpoint should be to show all of them.</p>
<p>So it might make sense to not try to do a single cut-away, but maybe do two cutaways from different viewpoints, or a cut-away
and then a separate render of one or more views.  I need your help on deciding the simplest way that will adequately show
everything.</p>
