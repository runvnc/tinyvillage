<p>Please read <a href="https://runvnc.github.io/tinyvillage">https://runvnc.github.io/tinyvillage</a>.  The following may make small changes to that concept.</p>
<p>The Tiny Villages concept will be shown with a 3d model animated to show different views with annotations and
highlights breaking down different aspects of the system.</p>
<p>This will be a 3d line drawing, with no textures or lighting, showing simplified outlines of core shapes.</p>
<h3 id="view-1-tiny-village-versus-suburban-home">View 1 -- Tiny Village versus Suburban Home</h3>
<p>There are two 60x60&#39; residential plots shown in this initial view.</p>
<p>The left side of the screen shows a 3d outline of the tiny village concept. There are 9 buildings and two 6&#39; passages.
The buildings and passages are layed out in the following pattern:</p>
<p>R-- residential/commercial
C-- commercial
A-- agricultural</p>
<pre><code>| C|R|C
|       
| R|R|R
| A|A|A 
</code></pre><p>In the initial view, the zoning (commercial/residential/agricultural) is not labeled or highlighted.</p>
<p>Each building is 17 x 17 feet and two stories, except for two of the residential which are a single story.  For phase 1 they
are simply modeled as boxes.  The agricultural buildings have large windows on three sides and 2/3 of the top.<br>Each building has five 250 watt solar panels, modeled as rectangles/flattened cubes for phase 1, and a VAWT 
(vertical access wind turbine) modeled as cylinders for phase 1.</p>
<p>On top of the buildings, except for the three agricultural, is a small garden area outlined in green (garden details left out
of initial outline view).</p>
<p>The floor of the passages is covered with <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solar-roadways#/">solar roadways</a> represented
with hexagonal tiling for phase 1.
There are two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIAu2b_rHw">velomobiles</a> parked on the side passage, 
modeled as small blimp-like shapes for phase 1. </p>
<p>On the right hand side of the screen, shown as being &#39;next door&#39;, is a simplified (low poly, 3d lines) representation of a 
suburban home with a back yard.  The home occupies 2/3 of the lot, with 1/3 back yard.  Tiny brown cigars in the back
yard represent pet waste from the family dog.  There is a sedan parked in the driveway. </p>
<p>A bottom section has annotations for the left and right side.<br>The left side is captioned &quot;Tiny Village&quot; and the right &quot;Suburban Home&quot;.  A series of
comparisons is displayed below the captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>left: Occupants: 9, right: Occupants: 3</li>
<li>left: annual kwh used: 10000, right: annual kwh used: 12000</li>
<li>left: annual calories produced: 300000, right: annual calories produced: 0</li>
